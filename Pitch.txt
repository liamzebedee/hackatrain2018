OH I’d love to get to go to Britney Spears gurl, but I have no way of getting home

Meet Sonne, a young 20 something with disposable income. She loves going to conerts, eating goats cheese and vanilla spice lattes

[1]
50K people go to the concert
[2]
Out of those 50k, transport providers only accounted for 12k
[3]
But there are 32k who can’t get back

Why is this?
We have foresight to plan for capacity
We have the transport infrastructure: NS, Arrive, Obikes
But consumers still can’t make that last smile?

We have the solution.

[show dashboard]
You’re looking at a real life transport marketplace, powered by smart contracts.

The transport providers tell it what services they have and the capacity they need to economically run it.

[do realtime]
And the smart contract automatically matches them in realtime with customers based on their location and budget.

[show provider page]
For a provider, that means they’re getting more information in advance about capacity and their customers.

Most importantly, for you, it automatically matches you with every possible option to make it back from BRITNAYYYY.

It holds your deposit for every provider,

and your ticket is a code accepted in every transit.

Finally, after all that trekking, you’re home for sleep and some relaxing whale tunes.

We are lastsmile: connecting transport providers, making that last mile and that smile last.

Thank you.
