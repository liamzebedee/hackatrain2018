===============

This is an open transport provider network implemented as a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

 - `ethereum-open-transport-provider-network/contracts` contains the Solidity contracts developed using the Truffle framework.
 - `ethereum-open-transport-provider-network/app` is a web interface that renders realtime updates from the Ethereum smart contract
 - `integration-example` is an example of a Python script that interacts with the contract.

This project was developed during Hackatrain 2018. GPL v3 license.

## The contract
The contracts are:

 - TransportOffer
 - TransportRequest
 - TransportMarket

And are [implemented here](https://github.com/liamzebedee/hackatrain2018/blob/master/ethereum-open-transport-provider-network/contracts/TransportMarket.sol).
